Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

Hi Louise,

The analysis is done.  I'm sharing the files I've created for your consideration.  My findings are that may/June are the best time to begin a fundraiser.  Also, projects requesting $4000 appear to have a better success rate.

Please let me know if you have further questions or inquiries.  Thank you, Leslie
